# Always
- Apply strong typing, avoid type casting or using any unless absolutely necessary, call it out in a comment why if needed
- Try to utilize functional programming and make logic stateless and unit testable
- Write tests to accompany new logic or modified existing logic. The test file should be in the same directory with the same name
- Unit tests or tests that don't require external calls should end with .unit.test.ts
- Integration tests or tests that require additional infrastructure or network calls should end with .integ.test.ts
